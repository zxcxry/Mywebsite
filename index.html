 <h1> Here are some fun facts about Manchester United!!! <h1> 
  Manchester United won the first Double in the year of 1994. Next, it became the first English club to win a Treble while winning the FA Cup, the Premier League, and UEFA Champions League simultaneously during 1998-1999. The team continued the fabulous upswing by beating Palmeiras to become the club world champions.
<p> Manchester United was founded in 1878 under the name Newton Heath LYR Football Club. By 1901, it was on the verge of disappearing due to its economic crisis. Club captain Harry Stafford decided to start walking his dog to raise money until the dog went missing one day. After a desperate search, Stafford finally found the dog in a pub. A few beers later, Stafford convinced the wealthy pub owner to invest in his team, and that’s how Newton Heath was saved, and Manchester United came to be.
  No one has won more Premier League titles than Manchester United.  Red Devils have won 13 times out of the 28 seasons played so far. But Manchester also leads the tournament’s historical table in terms of most wins, most goals, and most points won. <p>
